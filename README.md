## Welcome

Welcome to the Mongo Mentor!

Many groups and organizations want to leverage the power of Gen AI but due to any number of security and privacy concerns are unable to do so.

The purpose of this repo is to explore the feasibility of using and fine tuning a platform agnostic model for use offline or on secure networks.

### Platform Agnostic?

What do I mean by platform agnostic?

As is often the case organizations will accumulate a variety of devices with different hardware and capabilities.

Some users may have windows on an intel chip with access to a gpu and other may be on an Apple laptop with an M1 chip.

So by platform agnostic I'd like to see what the possibilities and hurdles are of having some code that can be downloaded and run from any number of users.

### Why Mongo?

There are plenty of Gen AI models with specific focuses on popular langues such as python but I'd like to see the efficacy of a more base model that is fine tuned with highly specific training data.

Additionally I have a professional curiosity of how well the model will due with a less popular language such as MQL.

### How are we doing this?

Given that I want to see if we can keep the process simple for a variety of user experiences I'll be attempting to use off the shelf tools that are easy to implement without overly complex environments.

Along the way in this journey we'll also be querying data sets from Google Cloud so buckle up and click into the 'data' notebook to find out how that goes!
