Here is a console.log of the returned object:</p>\\n<pre><code>locationsReadOne: {\\n  facilities: [ 'Hot drinks', 'Food', 'Premium wifi' ],\\n  _id: 5f88bfdc4df4ca7709462865,\\n  name: 'Starcups',\\n  address: '125 High Street, Reading, RG6 1PS'\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If I call Loc.aggregate, the rating field is returned:</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n  _id: 5f8b2ee15b0b6784a847b600,\\n  facilities: [ 'Tea', ' Restroom' ],\\n  name: 'Tea Leaf',\\n  address: '2192 Green St.',\\n  rating: 0,\\n\\n}\\n{\\n  _id: 5f88bfdc4df4ca7709462865,\\n  name: 'Starcups',\\n  address: '125 High Street, Reading, RG6 1PS',\\n  rating: 3,\\n  facilities: [ 'Hot drinks', 'Food', 'Premium wifi' ]\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Any idea why this would happen? I can clearly see the rating field in each of the documents in MongoDB compass and they are all listed as type Double. Why are they being returned in aggregate, but not in findById(id) or even in find()?</p>\\n<p>Thank you.</p>\\n ### Answer: <p>When you use <code>find</code> in mongoose, it will populate the document with the fields from the schema. For example - if you remove a field from the schema, you may not see that on the found document, even if it is in the database. Aggregate and Compass are showing you exactly what's in the database, so that data is there, it is just not being populated on the document because it doesn't see it on the schema.</p>\\n<p>The reason for that is your <code>ratingSchema</code> is an object with a <code>rating</code> property. So mongoose is looking for something like:</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n  name: ...\\n  rating: {\\n     rating: 2 \\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And not finding it, so it's not populating. To fix this, I would not define rating as a subschema, and instead define your schema as</p>\\n<pre><code>const locationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ \\n    name: {\\n        type: String,\\n        required: true,\\n    },\\n    address: {\\n        type: String,\\n        required: true,\\n    },\\n    rating: {\\n        type: Number,\\n        default: 0,\\n        min: 0,\\n        max: 5\\n    },   \\n    facilities: [String],\\n});\\n</code></pre>\",\n",

I wasn\\'t using a mongo password as originally I was only testing mongo locally. Then when I set the bindIp to 0.0.0.0 for remote access, it meant anyone can access if they guess the host (this is pretty dumb of me).</p>\\n<p>Always secure the server with a password especially if your bindIp is 0.0.0.0. For instructions see <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/features/mongodb-authentication\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.mongodb.com/features/mongodb-authentication</a></p>\\n<hr />\\n<h3>More Detail</h3>\\n<p>To check if you have been ransom attacked, look for a ransom note. An extra database may appear see <code>show dbs</code> in my case the new db with ransom note was called &quot;READ__ME_TO_RECOVER_YOUR_DATA&quot;</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>All your data is a backed up. You must pay 0.05 BTC to 1Kz6v4B5CawcnL8jrUvHsvzQv5Yq4fbsSv 48 hours for recover it. After 48 hours expiration we will leaked and exposed all your data. In case of refusal to pay, we will contact the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR and notify them that you store user data in an open form and is not safe. Under the rules of the law, you face a heavy fine or arrest and your base dump will be dropped from our server!

For other systems the filename might be mongodb.log. For me there are a series of commands around the attack time in the log, the first of which reads:</p>\\n<pre><code>{&quot;t&quot;:{&quot;$date&quot;:&quot;2022-08-07T09:54:37.779+00:00&quot;},&quot;s&quot;:&quot;I&quot;,  &quot;c&quot;:&quot;COMMAND&quot;,  &quot;id&quot;:20337,   &quot;ctx&quot;:&quot;conn30393&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;dropDatabase - starting&quot;,&quot;attr&quot;:\\n{&quot;db&quot;:&quot;READ__ME_TO_RECOVER_YOUR_DATA&quot;}}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>the command drops the database or starts dropping the db. As suspected there are no commands to read any data which means the attacker isn\\'t backing up as they claim. Unfortunately someone actually payed this scammer earlier this month. <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/65d035ca4db759a73bd9cb68610e04742ffe0e0b71ecdf88f54c7e464ee80a51\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/65d035ca4db759a73bd9cb68610e04742ffe0e0b71ecdf88f54c7e464ee80a51</a></p>',\n",
